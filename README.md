# PRE - [Project Azide](http://mew.cx/pn3) Gen 2 Plenoptic Rendering Engine

This Plenoptic Rendering Engine (PRE) began with the [lefdy](https://github.com/pbostley/lefdy-origin) Objective Rendering Engine (ORE) as its baseline.  The original lefdy/README has been renamed to [README_lefdy.txt](https://github.com/ProjectAzide/PRE/blob/master/README_lefdy.txt).

The Gen 2 hardware differs from Gen 1 by using the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) as its compute module, rather than the [Inforce 6410](https://www.inforcecomputing.com/inforce-6410-family).  By moving to the RasPi0, this engine must be ported from OpenGL to OpenGL ES.
